Units used in GNOME / PyGNOME
===========================

GNOME is a model of physical processes, and thus most of the things computed are in various physical units.

To keep things clean, the internal computational code is all handled in a consistent set of units. All values are stored in floating point types, generally 64 bit (``double``) unless otherwise noted.

Conversion is done on I/O or occasionally within a class (i.e the class may store data in the units the user gave, but return values in the standard unit to other parts of the code) So unless otherwise noted, pass data into methods in the following standard units:

Time
    Time is expressed in integer seconds -- stored in a C ``unsigned long``
    
    Date-times are in seconds since 1904 (1904-01-01T00:00) -- stored in a C ``unsigned long``
   
    (NOTE: much of the Python code uses ``datetime.datetime`` objects and/or numpy ``datetime64`` objects, but the internal C++ code uses integer seconds)

Length
    Lengths are in meters   

Mass
    Mass is in  grams

Volume
    Volume is in cubic meters

Density
    Density is in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm^3)

Velocity
    Velocities are in meters per second 
    
Latitude-Longitude
   Lat-long is in floating point degrees  -- range generally -360 to 360, so we can do stuff accross the date line.

Diffusion Coefficients
   Diffusion coefficients (for both vertical and horizontal random diffusion) are given in units of square centimeters per second cm^2/s

Droplet Diameter
   Droplet Diameter is given and returned in meters
